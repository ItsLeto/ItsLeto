Hi, I’m Herwig also know as Leto (@LetoTheDev)

I am a Software Developer in C++ . 
I’m interested in almost every C++ related topic and in optimised keyboard layouts. I use the [ISRT layout](https://notgate.github.io/layout/) on a [ferris sweep keyboard](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).
Currently I am learning the Rust programming language and trying to transition from vscode to nvim.

If you want to get in touch with me you can drop me an email at:
